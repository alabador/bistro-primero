## How It's Made

Tech Used: HTML, Vanilla CSS

## Lessons Learned

Making sure all screen sizes are accounted for, and adjusting for responsiveness. For this project, I was only given desktop designs, and had to scale down. If starting from the beginning, I would like to implement a mobile-first approach.
